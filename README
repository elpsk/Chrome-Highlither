### Classes

If your markup can be translated using a Ruby library, that's examples. Let's look at Markdown:

    markup(:markdown, /md|mkdn?|markdown/) do |content|
      Markdown.new(content).to_html
    end

block to run with unformatted markup which should return HTML.

If you need to monkeypatch a RubyGem or something, check out the
included RDoc example.

Tests should be added in the same manner as described under the
`Commands` section.


Usage
-----

    require 'github/markup'
    GitHub::Markup.render('README.markdown', "* One\n* Two")

Or, more realistically:

    require 'github/markup'
    GitHub::Markup.render(file, File.read(file))


Testing
-------

To run the tests:

    $ rake

To add tests see the `Commands` section earlier in this
README.
